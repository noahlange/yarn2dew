Pierre: The quantum fluctuations are intensifying. We need to jump now.
Lewis: But the calculations aren't complete. We could end up anywhere.
Pierre: The wormhole is collapsing. It's now or never.
Lewis: Fine. Initiate jump sequence.
Pierre: Something's wrong. We're being pulled backward...
Lewis: That's impossible. Unless...
Pierre: We're arriving before we left. We've become our own rescue mission.
-> Let's alter our trajectory and break this temporal loop!
    Pierre: Risky, Captain. We'd be writing ourselves out of existence.
    -> Damnit, Navigator! Nothing can stop me existing!
        Pierre: *sigh* Very well, Captain.
    -> By gods! You're right!
        Pierre: But it's only solution, I fear.
-> We must complete the cycle. Our past selves depend on it.
    Pierre: Then we're doomed to repeat this moment... forever.
    -> If we're doomed, at least we'll be remembered as heroes.
        Pierre: .. if anyone remembers us at all
    -> Forever... forever... forever...
        Pierre: Sir?
    -> We must do it!
        Pierre: As always, sir, you're right.
Lewis: Annnnnywayyy!
